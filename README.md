a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

Frameworks are now available for pretty much all programming languages. 
Explain the value of a framework like Sails.js. 

* The value of a framework like sails provides any application with a certain functionality based in processes and methods prebuilt into said application as long as the application follows the layout set forth by the framework itself. (i.e Must use create/edit/close for creating, editing, and closing a method within the appplication that is usinng the Sails.js framework.

What are the positive aspects, and what are the negative aspects of a framework as opposed to creating the full site from scratch?

* The positive aspects of a framework is as follows:
Cost and time saving: You don't have to code in the very basic functions before you get to the fun portion of the application.
Pre existing methods within the framework allows you to call upon them without having to code the method into each app file you create.

* The negative aspect of the framework is as follows:
Inflexibility: If the method does not exist within the framework, you'll have to spend extra time coding and testing the method to see if it works within the framework.
Constraint: If the framework says no and all ways to conform the method to work within the framework says no, you are forced to either code it outside of the framework or leave it out all together

Why not create the full site from scratch?
* Time, money, and manpower needed to create a full site from scratch might not be worth it if the same site can be achieved from using the frame work. Of course the tradeoff is the need to use the methods provided in the framework.

What applications could benefit from using a framework?
* Certain applications that can benefit from the framework can be as small as making a small wiki search engine up to a day to day update site for stocks.

Describe an application where a framework may not be appropriate.
* A few applications that a framework is not appropriate is application that require second by second update, Application that deals with sensitive informationn (This usually is better off building by hand), and applications with specific additions into the application as specified by the boss/personn issuinng the request.

Describe 3 things you learned from this assignment.
* Three things I have learned is the process of using a version log to keep track of the app version I am working on. The second thing I have learned from the assignment is how to deploy the application I have created onto the internet via heroku (Although this lesson can be used by anny hosting service like heroku). The Third thing I have learned is the value of the framework like sails.js. This assignment would have been alot longer had we been forced to code it via java.

How could this assignment be improved?
* I would say do some of the assignment in class as a demostration. Some of the concepts I had to implemennt, I still don't fully understand
